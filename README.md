# Event Trigger Platform

A scalable event trigger platform that supports scheduled and API-based triggers with event logging and monitoring capabilities.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed with the assistance of several AI tools:

- [Cursor.ai](https://cursor.ai/) - AI-powered code editor that provided intelligent code suggestions and completions
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - Helped with code review, debugging, and architectural decisions
- [Claude](https://anthropic.com/claude) - Assisted with documentation writing and API design

These AI tools significantly enhanced the development process and helped create a more robust and well-documented solution.

## Live Demo

The application is deployed on Vercel at: https://y-d3q1rf5z4-shreeshas-projects-779b213d.vercel.app/

## Features

- Scheduled and API-based triggers
- Event logging and monitoring
- Real-time event tracking
- Event archival system
- REST API endpoints
- Containerized deployment
- MongoDB integration

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/ShreeshaPradeep/event-trigger-platform
cd event-trigger-platform


2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
env
MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://your-mongodb-url
DATABASE_NAME=event_triggers
ENVIRONMENT=development

3. Build and run using Docker Compose:
bash
docker-compose up --build

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## Cost Analysis (30 days, 5 queries/day)

### Free Tier Resources:
- Vercel Hobby Plan (Free)
- MongoDB Atlas Free Tier
- Docker Hub Free Tier

### Monthly Usage:
- API Calls: 5 queries/day Ã— 30 days = 150 calls/month
- Database Storage: ~100MB
- Container Registry: 1 repository

### Total Cost: $0/month
All services used are within free tier limits:
- Vercel: Free for hobby projects
- MongoDB Atlas: Free tier includes 512MB storage
- Docker Hub: Free for public repositories

## Architecture

The application uses:
- FastAPI for the backend API
- MongoDB for data storage
- APScheduler for scheduled tasks
- Docker for containerization
- Vercel for deployment

## Testing

Run tests using Docker:
bash
docker-compose run app pytest


## Limitations

Free tier limitations:
- Vercel: Cold starts on serverless functions
- MongoDB Atlas: 512MB storage limit
- Limited concurrent connections
- Basic monitoring features only
